# Autnomous-Car-with-Image-Processing
In this project we have used raspiberry pi for image processing and arduino as a slave with certain sensors for object detection.

This project endeavors to construct a prototype autonomous vehicle incorporating advanced image processing techniques to independently traverse a predetermined course. The vehicle will feature a sophisticated camera and processing unit with the capability to identify crucial elements such as lane markings, traffic signs, and obstacles along the route. Leveraging this perceptual information, the car will autonomously determine optimal steering, acceleration, and braking actions to navigate the designated path safely and efficiently. 
The principal objectives of this initiative include the development of a robust image processing model proficient in detecting lane markings, traffic signs, and obstacles through camera input. This model will then be seamlessly integrated with a comprehensive control system, translating the acquired sensor information into precise steering, acceleration, and braking commands. The ultimate aim is to showcase the vehicle's capacity to navigate autonomously along the predefined path, demonstrating its real-time responsiveness to visual cues and reinforcing its potential for broader applications in the realm of autonomous transportation.
